										<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
										<p>Hi, my name is Deneva Widyaningtyas
											I'm a fresh graduate of Geological Engineering major, and recently I'm eager to learn about Data Science fields. Although my background is not IT, statistics, or math, I have a strong passion to continue learning outside of my field of study and deepen this data field. After graduate, I joined some data science bootcamp, and also did self-learning through several online platforms.
											I'm really still a beginner, so I'm asking for corrections and suggestions for each project that I include in this portfolio, which is my first works ‚úåüèªüòÅ</p>
